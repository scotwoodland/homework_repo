# Accessibility Refractor

## Description

Beginning with existing code, I analyzed the accessibility based upon the current web standards (WCAG) as well as current 508 Compliance benchmarks. After adding or changing multiple colors, contrasts, broken links, ‘alt’ tags, and font sizes to comply with the aforementioned standards, I ran the site through an online 508 compliance text to verify adherence. I then ensured the HTML element structures and headings were in a logical format.
